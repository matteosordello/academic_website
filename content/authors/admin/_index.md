I have been working as a Data Scientist in the Storage Analytics team at Google since July 2021.

Previously, I was a PhD Student in the [Statistics Department](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/) at the [Wharton School](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/), University of Pennsylvania, under the supervision of Professor [Weijie Su](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/suw/). 

Before joining UPenn, I studied Mathematics at the [University of Turin](https://www.matematica.unito.it/do/home.pl) and Statistics at [Collegio Carlo Alberto](https://www.carloalberto.org/), where I completed my Master's thesis under the supervision of Professor [Matteo Ruggiero](http://www.matteoruggiero.it/).
